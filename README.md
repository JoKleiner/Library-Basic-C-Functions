# Standart-Library
The standard library is a collection of basic library functions in C.
This repository is intended to help me gain a deeper understanding of how the standard library functions work and to use my own version in other projects.

Key Features

    Reimplementation of core functions
    This library includes recreated versions of commonly used functions like:
        printf: Flexible and powerful formatted output.
        ft_split: Splits a string into an array of substrings based on a delimiter.
        strjoin: Combines two strings into one.
