# Standart-Library
The standard library is a collection of basic library functions in C.
This repository is intended to help me gain a deeper understanding of how the functions of the standard library work and to use my own version in other projects.



Input/Output Functions:
- ft_printf:             Prints data to standard output.
- get_next_line:    Reads a line from a file descriptor.

Memory Functions:
- ft_bzero.c:       Sets all bytes in a memory area to zero.
- ft_calloc.c:      Allocates memory and initializes all bytes to zero.
- ft_memset.c:      Fills a memory block with a specific byte value.
- ft_memcpy.c:      Copies a memory block to another location.
- ft_memmove.c:     Copies memory with overlapping areas handled safely.
- ft_memchr.c:      Locates the first char in a memory block.
- ft_memcmp.c:      Compares two memory areas.

Linked List Functions:
- ft_lstnew.c:      Creates a new linked list node.
- ft_lstlast.c:     Returns the last node of a linked list.
- ft_lstadd_back.c: Adds a new node to the end of a linked list.
- ft_lstclear.c:    Clears and frees all nodes of a linked list.
  
Conversion Functions:
- ft_atoi.c:        Converts a string to an integer.
- ft_itoa.c:        Converts an integer to a string.

String Manipulation Functions:
- ft_strlen.c:      Returns the length of a string.
- ft_strdup.c:      Duplicates a string in a newly allocated memory block.
- ft_strjoin.c:     Concatenates two strings into a new string.
- ft_strlcpy.c:     Copies a string to a destination buffer with size limit.
- ft_split.c:       Splits a string into substrings using a delimiter.
  
Further Functions:
- ft_putendl_fd.c:  Writes a string followed by a newline.
- ft_putnbr_fd.c:   Writes an integer as a string.
- ft_putstr_fd.c:   Writes a string.
- ft_putchar_fd.c:  Writes a single character.
- ft_isalpha.c:     Checks if a character is an alphabetic letter.
- ft_isdigit.c:     Checks if a character is a decimal digit.
- ft_isalnum.c:     Checks if a character is alphanumeric (letter or digit).
- ft_isascii.c:     Checks if a character is part of the ASCII set.
- ft_isprint.c:     Checks if a character is printable, including space.
- ft_tolower.c:     Converts an uppercase letter to lowercase.
- ft_toupper.c:     Converts a lowercase letter to uppercase.
- ft_strchr.c:      Finds the first character in a string.
- ft_strrchr.c:     Finds the last character in a string.
- ft_strncmp.c:     Compares two strings up to a specified number of characters.
- ft_strnstr.c:     Locates a substring within a string.
- ft_strlcat.c:     Concatenates two strings with size limit for the destination.
- ft_strmapi.c:     Applies a function to each character of a string to create a new string.
- ft_striteri.c:    Applies a function to each character of a string, modifying it in place.
- ft_substr.c:      Extracts a substring from a string.
- ft_strtrim.c:     Trims characters from the beginning and end of a string.
